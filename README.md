## Getting started

### Development hint: TypeScript compiler in watch mode

In VS Code, open the integrated terminal. Once open, click _Split Terminal_ to get two terminals side-by-side.

In the one teminal run `npm run tsc` to start the TypeScript compiler in watch mode. It'll watch input files and trigger recompilation on changes, giving immediate feedback on syntax or type errors (`.ts` files only) that might have crept in.
